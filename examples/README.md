# Examples

This directory contains example scripts demonstrating how to use GaitSim Assist.

## Basic Examples

- `basic_simulation.py`: Demonstrates how to create a simulator, run simulations with different cost functions, and visualize the results.

## Advanced Examples

- `custom_cost_function.py`: Shows how to create and use custom cost functions.
- `assistive_device_optimization.py`: Demonstrates how to optimize assistive device parameters.
- `batch_processing.py`: Shows how to run multiple simulations in batch mode.

## Running Examples

To run an example, make sure GaitSim Assist is installed, then run:

```bash
python examples/basic_simulation.py
```

## Output

Most examples save their output to the `simulation_results` directory. This includes:

- CSV files with simulation data
- PNG files with visualizations
- JSON files with metrics and parameters
