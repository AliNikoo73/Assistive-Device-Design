"""
Cost function implementations for assistive device design optimization.

This package contains implementations of various cost functions used in the
optimization of assistive device parameters, including:
- Cost of transport (CoT)
- Muscle effort
- Joint torque
- Fatigue
- Head motion
- Hybrid (combination of CoT and muscle effort)
